As I sit and strike the keyboard to place letters on my laptop screen, I am intently searching for the words that scoop and grasp my muddled thoughts — particles floating like space debris in the lawless universe of my mind — hoping to deliver them safely to whomever might be willing to receive them. Yet this attempt is always, at best, a sea of adversities. This is not due to a malfunction of the speech centre in my cerebrum or the emotional confusion that I had befriended alongside puberty; it is simply due to acceptance, if not resignation, of the undeniable fact that words can not do justice to the complexity of life that we carry around with us. Despite words being floating combinations of letters and sounds, vulnerable just like the concept of money, we hold an unshakable faith towards these human creations. </br></br>

One day I will find the right words, and they will be simple.</br></br>

These are the exact words scribbled on to the corner of a page torn out from an old notebook, and clumsily pasted on to my bathroom door. It has been a habit acquired throughout the years, to jot down words that had caught my attention and stick them to any nearby surface. Initially, it was a ritual deriving from the fear and sorrow at how easily things could be forgotten or distorted in my mind as time passed. However recently, I had an epiphany: perhaps it was an act of self-guidance. A hopeful, continuous reminder to wonder until that day when I am wise enough to fully understand the meaning of those words, for the author but more so for me. Why in that moment did these exact words pop out of the pages and shout at my conscience? I wanted a reason then, and I still search for them now.</br></br> 

Words. The meat and potatoes of communication.</br></br>

Not many people stop amidst a conversation to think: is the person sitting across from me, who is listening to the same exact collation of words as I, understanding them exactly the same way I do? Perhaps this is not an important process in order to have a smoothly carried conversation; and rightfully so, which I will later on explain why. </br></br>


Communication. The human desire to share.</br></br>

The term communication derives from the latin verb communicare which means ‘to share’. Sharing is an act of distribution, conciliation, elucidation, and compromise. Hence the terms ambiguity and communication seem to be standing on the opposite polar. Besides that, the term communication nowadays can be used in the tone of, if not as a complete synonym, to clarity. “Communicate” can be a one word demand towards somebody to make their stance articulate and clear. Therefore ambiguity of words, from the common notion of verbal and textual communication, may sound and seem like an oxymoron. As much as ambiguity and communication can be a parallel counterpart depending on the context, ambiguity will always be an inhabitant of any existing word.</br></br></br></br></br></br>

		<div class="textCol">Introduction Version 2: The personal
I was always fascinated with ambiguity. The grey area. The intangible. The complexity. Where ends didn’t meet. The unexplainable. Humanity never seemed black or white but grey. That was what attracted me more than pure facts as we had come to know it.This became a constant source of guilt for me, especially since moving to the Western society as an adult and studying the arts where individual statement seemed so important. I thought this mentality derived from laziness or lack of concern; that I wasn’t determined enough to frame it black or white, or confident enough to structure a fixed opinion about something that no matter who poked me from whatever angle I can dodge every single one and prove I was a thorough thinker. It was unsatisfying to think I was shrugging my passive shoulder saying “Well, we all experience life differently, and we just need to deal with it” because there seemed to me is a force in this society that encourages us to declare what is true for ourselves, in black or white. However, the recent months I have come to the idea that perhaps there is some kind of truth in this ambiguity that we can’t access just by will power and that this “some kind of truth” must be the reason of my fascination. 

So here I am, trying to grapple the impossible, within the restriction of merely 7000 words.

The most thinkable starting point for me in this search was language and words, my other constant obstacle and reminder of a void in communication. Ludwig Wittgenstein called language a labyrinth of paths, that “you approach from one side and you know your way about; you approach the same place from another side and you no longer know your way about.” Ref 1

		<div class="textCol" id="wordworldtext">The what’s and how’s of words: our most used communication tool and the psychology behind it

Let’s start with briefly looking at what words are and how they can be.

Why do we think that when we communicate in words, others understand them the same way that we do? A simple answer could be that we have dictionaries to fall back on, giving us definitions and etymology, and the thesaurus to reassure us that our thoughts are expressible in innumerable ways and will eventually land on the right one. In social psychology, the false consensus effect (Ref 2 The “False Consensus Effect”: An Egocentric Bias in Social Perception and Attribution Processes LEE Ross, DAVID GREENE, AND PAMELA HOUSE Stanford University Received April 21, 1976)  can also be referred to. It is, simply put, how we tend to project our way of thinking onto other people, assuming other people think the same way as we do. We have developed our Theory of Mind (ref 3 http://www.iep.utm.edu/theomind/), a cognitive behavior to ascribe mental states to other people, and yet we still can not escape this assumption. In many cases, this assumption can act as a lubricant in everyday social interactions, allowing an extent of smoothness and linearity in the conversation. 

We are taught from a young age to read and write, spell out words we will probably never use, and receive brownie points for knowing the longest word in the dictionary. Our obsession with words and seeing it as “one index of intelligence” might also be a source of our craving. To be the living proof of this, I have kept track of all the words I’ve searched during this writing process; either from reading or with the intention of using correctly. (Ref3 subjective dictionary) 
The more words you know the better. But why? Language gives us “symbols we can use to fix ideas, reflect on them and hold them up for observation.” (Ref 4http://mentalfloss.com/article/50684/it-possible-think-without-language) It allows for a level of abstract reasoning we wouldn’t have otherwise. That means that the more words we have, we could potentially have a wider range of thought and ways to put them out to our external environment. 

The way in which words are “authorless”, are similar to how nature concerns no ownership, yet dissimilar in the sense that nature is not human creation. It is similar to how culture is an organic and long-term crowd-sourced result of human activity, yet dissimilar in the sense that cultures are usually exclusive to the contributors and followers labelling themselves as part of the group  (also contributors). As linguist Edward Sapir put it, “Language is the most massive and inclusive art we know, a mountainous and anonymous work of unconscious generations.” (Ref 5) Words, like no other creation, is accessible, used and shared by people without any ownership (unless trademarked, ridiculously enough). 

Itsuo Kohama, Japanese critic, writer and philosopher mentions in his book なぜ言葉は通じないのか(Why Words Don’t Communicate) (Ref6), one of the seven characteristics of words as its inclination to create an illusion of something abstract to be a real entity. An example of this tendency can be observed in Freud’s definition of id, ego and super-ego, which are interacting agents in the psychic apparatus. Not to mention these are theoretical constructs of our mental life, the space in which we can only access alone and never fully identify, and also a purely psychological concept that does not correspond to somatic structures of the brain such as neuroscience. Freud, keen and cautious, had emphasized the fact that they were nothing more than models, but his disciples and successors daringly utilized these words as if they were pre-existing entities, raising highly speculative debates. Kohama writes that God, time, or particles are the same in the sense that once coined or verbalized, the presence of an entity that was once an abstract concept starts closing in and creates the inevitable debate of its credibility, existence, and the whats-its. Once something is, it is all but natural for humans to be curious of the whys-its, hows-its, wheres-its and take on deeply philosophical investigations. And interestingly enough, even when these concepts such as time and space are being discussed as a priori condition, all terms coined around this discussion come from our surroundings and physical experiences. Kant, in Transcendental Idealism uses words such as external objects (bodies), inner sense (my thoughts), about self-consciousness and writes: “But since the expression outside us carries with it an unavoidable ambiguity, since it sometimes signifies something that, as a thing in itself [Ding an sich selbst], exists distinct from us and sometimes merely that belongs to outer appearance, then in order to escape uncertainty and use this concept in the latter significance—in which it is taken in the proper psychological question about the reality of our outer intuition—we will distinguish empirically external objects from those that might be called “external” in the transcendental sense, by directly calling them ‘things that are to be encountered in space’”(ref 7https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-transcendental-idealism/). The notion of in/out (internal/external) cannot be detached from the physical placement in the natural world we inhabit, whether that is the experiences of being outside a wall or inside skin. Reflecting our physical experiences into the metaphysical discussions allow us to, exchange better, although perhaps never quite entirely. Trying to avoid discord or lamenting the words’ innate limitation in representing, Kohama writes, is not a productive way to live; exchanging abstract concepts and emotions are part of essential human activities, and allowing ourselves to openly verbalize these inner sense or abstract concepts in an existential context, is the only way in achieving a moment where we might hit the nail on the head.

Words will fail us if we treat them as complete mediators. But mediators will never seem fully functional, if we intend our minds to be understood by others rather than interpreted.

Discussing words as mediator essentially seems to be talking about limitations. This isn’t a new thought but rather ancient; as the myth of the Tower of Babel represents, a dream of a common language probably lives on in humanity since we were first aware of the existence of languages other than just “ours”. If the Tower of Babel were to be internalized, it would in my case, probably look like a clumsy pile of paper with words highlighted and underlined or a gigantic roll of receipt paper with messy scribbles running across its surface. Learning new words or new ways of using known vocabulary gave me satisfaction in the way that it felt a little bit closer to filling the gap between my saying/showing distinction, as artist/researcher and author of Taxidermy for Language Animals Tine Melzer put it.(Ref 8) However, as a child, I needed flashcards to prepare for vocabulary exams, and I easily forgot  meanings of words if I didn’t use it often enough (which was always the case for English vocabulary in Japan). To give this mildly sad childhood episode some scientific flair, our declarative memories (“knowing what” or consciously recallable memories) are stocked in our brains as either episodic memories or semantic memories. The former is the memory of autobiographical events (times, places, associated emotions and other contextual knowledge), where individuals tend to see themselves as actors in these events, and the emotional charge and the entire context surrounding an event is usually part of the memory. The latter is a more structured record of facts, meanings, concepts and knowledge about the external world that we have acquired. Semantic memories may once have had a personal context, but now stand alone as simple knowledge, much of it being abstract and relational and is associated with the meaning of verbal symbols. Although declarative memories are subdivided into semantic/ episodic memory, semantic memory is generally derived from the episodic memory, in that we learn new facts or concepts from our experiences, and the episodic memory is considered to support and underpin semantic memory. Gradual transition from episodic to semantic memory takes place, in which episodic memory reduces its sensitivity and association to particular events, so that the information can be generalized as semantic memory. This means that learning the meaning of the word “hot” came from physically experiencing heat or witnessing that of others, and although these words became generalised information for our brains to be able to process information faster, words we know now as simply verbal symbols were once episodes, experiences, and emotions in our autobiography. (ref 9 http://www.human-memory.net/types_episodic.html)
Although my flashcards didn’t offer me episodic memories and opportunities to transition them into knowledge, it offers me now an insight into how we can treat words as once living memories instead of static bare data.

		<div class="textCol"><h2>Surrender to mediation: Noting the transcendant</h2>

A writer creates his or her sentences on the page, but the minute they are released to the world, they belong to the readers. American writer Cheryl Strayed raises an example of this: how many readers tattooed on their bodies a sentence from her novel: “How wild it was to let it be.” The significance in this act, is that it represents how we can own beauty that other people have made, simply because it lives within us. “I know what that line means to me, I know what that line means in the context of the book…but that individual who had that tattooed, it’s not mine, it’s not my story. Nobody is going to get that written on their body because it has something to do with me, it has something to do with them….It’s not so much about the intention but the meaning they took from it.” (ref 10 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmG5rCLTr8E&t=4289s)
Giving into the authorlessness of words may be an essential process of (successful) writing, or in any kind of verbal and textual communication for that matter. Mattijs van de Port, an anthropologist who works primarily with footage, specifically essay films, states that when textual and audio-visual anthropologies come together under one roof, one may make up for what the other lacks. Van de Port “faced the incompleteness of any attempt to mediate the world” when looking at anthropology as a practice of mediation.(Ref 11) Instead, his current approach is to document the environment “as it is,” and displays it without the mediation and interpretation of words.

Both stories of these two creators are similar in the sense that they have both surrendered to the authorlessness of words, and the undeniable fact that the intention of the transmitter is never ensured to be fully comprehended by the recipient. 

And yet I still could not agree with Van de Port’s argumentation that words can not be trusted to give the same immediate and bodily experience images can offer. I can not emphasise enough that Van de Port does not diminish what words can accomplish; instead he sought greatest power in the combination of both words and film in his practice. However when he states about footage that by “just watching them, I can ‘take them in’ without having to submit to the restrictions that come with qualification, without bringing the judgement to them that each and every word implies (ref12),” I was not fully convinced.  He refers to David Morgan (ref 13): ‘unlike the word, which has no necessary relation to its referent, the photograph possesses its referent within itself. It bears an ontological relation to its referent.’  Furthermore, referring to Vivian Sobchak and her analyses on the moment when films become translated into bodily responses; “commingling of flesh and consciousness…so that meaning an where it is made does not have a discrete origin in either bodies or representation, but merges from both”.(ref 14) But don’t we acquire meanings to words through experience? Are our memories of first hand experiences not the referents of our words? If so, aren’t the evocation caused by words also translatable into bodily experiences?

Suddenly, despite the seemingly opposing treatment of words within our views, him as a setback as mediator and mine as its imperfect qualities being the empowerment, something clicked. “The activation of the sensorium to respond,” as Van de Port describes a function of moving images, started to seem like the explanation to my habit of taking notes and pasting them to the wall, or underlining words that somehow grabs my attention in that moment in time. I did not recognise this as a bodily experience before. It does not touch me on the surface of my skin, or create a reflex in my muscles. However, ultimately it is a bodily reaction to something I could’ve either ignored or overlooked. I feel hooked, by a force making me read the same lines over and over again, mouthing them to imprint them stronger to my mind. In extreme cases, I even feel a chill down my spine, hair rise on the back of my neck. The words resonate with what was within me, pulling it out of my sub-conscience into somewhere closer to the surface of my body. As Van de Port also points out in his writing, “words trigger the imagination, which produces an endless stream of mental images” (ref 15). A sentence written by somebody else allowed me to own the beauty of it regardless of his or her intention, by triggering mental images of my past physical and mental experiences. Sometimes it doesn’t even occur as images but more intuitive and abstract, like recognising an old friend who resembles nothing of who you used to know. Something tells you that you must’ve felt it’s presence before. 

Philosopher Peter Carruthers has argued that there is a type of inner, explicitly linguistic thinking that allows us to bring our own thoughts into conscious awareness. (Ref16)  The power of words, for now at least, might be its capacity to inhabit what exceeds what we know to be true in our conscious minds. A great writer can show a truth to us that we somehow know to be true, yet capable of articulating ourselves until is was presented to us in that form of writing.

And this experience with words is so transcendent that it urges me to preserve it in the moment I felt it. By writing it down and pasting it to the wall may not entirely encapsulate what had come over me; but it is an attempt and my way of worship.
