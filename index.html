Words, semantics, communication and language philosophy. Essentially, what words can do. How the innate ambiguity and symbolistic quality of words may enhance communication.
Why do we struggle to accept the fact that words are our most trusted yet incomplete mediator in communication? How can we embrace the ambiguity of words and its symbolistic presence in shaping and delivering our ideas? What role does this have in the context of visual arts, specifically conceptual art and copywriting?
The ambiguity of words is innate as any other mediator in communication, yet this is easily overlooked, eventually causing misunderstandings and verbal quarrels. This quality however can also enhance communication and experience of the recipient when we embrace the imperfection of words as a mediator. Embracing would mean to separate intention from the affect, and to even value the affect over the intention.

Being bilingual and multicultural, I’ve developed conflicting views in verbal/textual communication; the western culture often demanding me to be precise and decide either black or white versus the eastern (japanese) culture demanding me to sugarcoat and be indirect, and value (or stay in) the grey area. As much as I get to take the best of two worlds, in most cases this causes a painful split in my though process. I believe this resonates with many people, since I’ve never heard of anybody who claims they are capable to encapsulate everything in words, and I want to investigate things that utilises this aspect of words gracefully and successfully.
Primarily reading text on language philosophy, linguistics, conceptual art and writing, but also at this point many parts are based on personal experience (lacking wider input?). 

In the beginning I was trying to keep things general, factual, and possibly ending in a “so we all see things differently and there is nothing we can do to solve it” note, but eventually by trying to tackle ambiguity with an ambiguous tool called words, the process of thinking and writing already became part of the answer. Fascinatingly, my many thoughts and lifelong interests have started to string and bundle together through this process, but my current concern is how to make it more relatable for others. 

How to embrace the sections which require translation, knowing that I don’t have the control over native intuition of the readers. Would this whole attempt make sense to people and if not how would I try to make it more accessible or interesting? How do I prove a point in such an innately subjective and intuitive topic?
