	<div id="textWrap">
		<div class="textCol"></div>
		<div class="textCol"><p>As I sit and strike the keyboard to place letters on my laptop screen, I am intently searching for the words that scoop and grasp my muddled thoughts — particles floating like space debris in the lawless universe of my mind — hoping to deliver them safely to whomever might be willing to receive them. Yet this attempt is always, at best, a sea of adversities. This is not due to a malfunction of the speech centre in my cerebrum or the emotional confusion that I had befriended alongside puberty; it is simply due to acceptance, if not resignation, of the undeniable fact that words can not do justice to the complexity of life that we carry around with us. Despite words being floating combinations of letters and sounds, vulnerable just like the concept of money, we hold an unshakable faith towards these human creations. </p>
		<p>One day I will find the right words, and they will be simple.</p>
		<p>These are the exact words scribbled on to the corner of a page torn out from an old notebook, and clumsily pasted on to my bathroom door. It has been a habit acquired throughout the years, to jot down words that had caught my attention and stick them to any nearby surface. Initially, it was a ritual deriving from the fear and sorrow at how easily things could be forgotten or distorted in my mind as time passed. However recently, I had an epiphany: perhaps it was an act of self-guidance. A hopeful, continuous reminder to wonder until that day when I am wise enough to fully understand the meaning of those words, for the author but more so for me. Why in that moment did these exact words pop out of the pages and shout at my conscience? I wanted a reason then, and I still search for them now. </p>
		<p>Words. The meat and potatoes of communication.</p>
		<p>Not many people stop amidst a conversation to think: is the person sitting across from me, who is listening to the same exact collation of words as I, understanding them exactly the same way I do? Perhaps this is not an important process in order to have a smoothly carried conversation; and rightfully so, which I will later on explain why. </p>
		<p>Communication. The human desire to share.</p>
		<p>The term communication derives from the latin verb communicare which means ‘to share’. Sharing is an act of distribution, conciliation, elucidation, and compromise. Hence the terms ambiguity and communication seem to be standing on the opposite polar. Besides that, the term communication nowadays can be used in the tone of, if not as a complete synonym, to clarity. “Communicate” can be a one word demand towards somebody to make their stance articulate and clear. Therefore the title Ambiguity of Words, from the common notion of verbal and textual communication, may sound and seem like an oxymoron. As much as ambiguity and communication can be a parallel counterpart depending on the context, ambiguity will always be an inhabitant of any existing word.</p>
